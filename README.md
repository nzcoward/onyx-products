## Yagni
I'm a big advocate of the YAGNI principle (You Aren't Gonna Need It). I believe in keeping things simple and only adding features when they are actually needed. This approach helps to avoid unnecessary complexity and keeps the codebase clean and maintainable.

The problem scope is very limited, so wary to add features that are not strictly necessary.

Build for evolution, not for perfection. Start with a simple solution and iterate on it as needed. 

I believe in focusing on the core functionality and delivering a product that meets the immediate needs of the users. The result is a shorter feedback loop, more engaged customers, and just better quality software overall.
